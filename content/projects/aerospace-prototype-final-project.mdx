# Project Description
For the Final Project of my class in Aerospace Prototypes in my bachelor we were tasked on designing a cargo aircraft that could lift the most Payload given some propulsion constraints.

With the objective of trying to desing an airplane differently as our previous experiences(From our participation in the university's SAE Aerodesign team), we set the task for ourself on designing the aircraft with more wood as previously done.
The idea was reduce the quantity of parts needed to be welded or machined, as it conventionally has been done in our university, and design as much as possible with Balsa wood and Sitka spruce, as other Universities' Team commonly do.
Â 
# Design Process

We modeled our design Proposals with Solidworks. We also tried to drive our designs with global sketches and parameters, allowing us to quickly vary the dimensioning of our aircraft and evaluate its performance with the different sizing.

After some team discussions and some preeliminary evaluations of the different design Proposals, we decided which configuration we were going to mainly focus on for the optimization of it.

# Model 
The following IFrame shows our model that we designed. Feel free to play around with it. Unfortunately some of the parts in the model  where not correctly interpreted in the Autodesk360 viewer (For example, the Rudder ).

# Analysis

We programmed a Matlab script for running different Aerodynamic Analysis  through XFLR5. We evaluated over a thousand configuration with our simplified Aerodynamic model so that we could obtain an idea on the sizing design space that we were going to focus.
We also statically structurally analyzed the aircraft by using Ansys Mechanical & we connected our Solidworks CAD model with Ansys, allowing us to quickly structurally analyse the aircraft.

# Performance 

Our Aircraft design was simpler compared to our Universities' traditional designs and had a better theoretical performance relative to our Univerities' designs.

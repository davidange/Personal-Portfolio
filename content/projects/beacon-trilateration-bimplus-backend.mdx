# Project Description
For our Software Lab Project , we proposed developing a Web application that can track Users in real time by utilizing BLE Beacons and also utilize BIMPlus for setting up the project and visualizing the user location.
For this, we decided on developing an Android App that will measure the approximate distances to the BLE Beacons and post those measurements to our Backend.
We also developed a Frontend in React to visualize and to set up our application. 

This Page will focus mainly on the **Backend**.

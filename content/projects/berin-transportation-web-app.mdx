# Project Description

For a coding challenge for a job I was tasked on developing a Web app for allowing users to see the Departures available from a desired Stop.
The API was provided, therefore I was only focused on developing the Frontend. One of the requirements was to develop it with Angular.

## Note
The Repository is not public as I was asked to keep it private.

Feel free to **[open](https://berlin-transportation-web-app.netlify.app/)** the app and test it.ðŸ˜¬

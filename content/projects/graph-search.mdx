# Background

As I did not had formal experience in computer Science and was wanting on experimenting how to apply some of the knowledge that I had obtained by the online courses in Datastructures & Algorithms, 
I decided on auditing the CS188 class Introduction to AI from UC Berkeley and program their excersices.

# Project description

The objective of this project was to implemnt some basic graph searches algorithms. Some of the implemented Algorithms where Breadth First search,
Depth First Search, Uniform Cost Search and A* Search (and different heuristics for computing the A* search).

Simirarly, an suboptimal search was also implemented as eventhough an A* search with a good heuristic  can take considerable amount of time to find the optimal path.
A search Agent was implemented that finds the closest path to a dot. Utilizing this approach, the program limits how deep it transverses the graph and
 based on the new location it decides what is the most optimal path it should take next.

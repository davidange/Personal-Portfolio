# Project Description

We implemented an Interactive ARAP for the lecture of 3D Scanning & Motion Capture (IN2354).

Interactive mesh deformation has wide use cases in the Fields of animation and computer
graphics. For example, it can be used for unwrapping a mesh or morphing one shape
into another, which is highly used in animation and computer games. The most important criterion for mesh deformation is to preserve 
the topology and scale, therefore imposing an "as rigid as possible" constraint. 

To achieve this, we define an energy term that represents the strain energy of each cell, defined as a 1-level fan of  the mesh.

# Results

The deformations obtained by our implementation are similar to those used as baseline.

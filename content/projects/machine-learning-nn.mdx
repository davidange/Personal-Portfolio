# Background

As I did not had formal experience in computer Science and was wanting on experimenting how to apply some of the knowledge that I had obtained by the online courses in Datastructures & Algorithms, 
I decided on auditing the CS188 class Introduction to AI from UC Berkeley and program their excersices.

# Project description

For this excercie, different Neural Networks were developed and trained to be able to predict the written number, language of a word and to fit some data points. 
Also, some of the basic functions needed to compute, evaluate and train  the Neural network were implemented.

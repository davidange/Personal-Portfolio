# Background

As I did not had formal experience in computer Science and was wanting on experimenting how to apply some of the knowledge that I had obtained by the online courses in Datastructures & Algorithms, 
I decided on auditing the CS188 class Introduction to AI from UC Berkeley and program their excersices.

# Project description

This excersices consisted on implementing different agents. From offline planers  (As the Value iteration) that do not actually learn from the agent's actions to
actual agents ,as a Q-Learning Agent, that interacts and learns from the model.

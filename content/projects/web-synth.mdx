# Project Description

This project objective was to familiarize myself with the Web Audio API and create an instrument that I can continue building on by adding additional AudioNodes.
At the same time I have always been interested in how audio programs work and this project was a good introduction on how soundwaves are processed in all the electronical instruments.

## How was it done?

This app was developed in React and programmed with Typescript. TailwindCSS was used as the main CSS library for this project. 
To produce the sounds,  the web Audio API was used. Inside the ASDR (Attack, Sustain, Decay and Release ) controls, a P5.js canvas was added so that the user can easily visualize the 
envelope that the sound will make.

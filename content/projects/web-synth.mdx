# Project Description

This project objective was to familiarize myself with the Web Audio API and create an instrument that I can continue building on by adding additional AudioNodes.
At the same time I have always been interested in how audio programs work and this project was a good introduction on how soundwaves are processed in all the electronical instruments.
## Technologies Used

This app was developed in React and programmed with Typescript. TailwindCSS was used as the main CSS library for this project.
